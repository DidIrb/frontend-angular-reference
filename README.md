# Angular Tutorial

This repository contains code examples and tutorials for learning and using Angular, a development platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and  [TypeScript](https://angular.io/docshttps://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/). Angular is open-source and helps us build dynamic and [sophisticated web applications](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/).

## What is Angular?
Angular is a typescript-based web application framework that supports full-stack development for building all types of [web applications](https://www.w3schools.in/angular/introduction). It helps in creating reactive single-page applications (SPAs) and is completely based on the concept of [components](https://www.w3schools.in/angular/introduction).

Angular has many features and benefits, such as:

- Modular design: Angular applications are composed of self-contained units of code called modules, which can be reused across different parts of the application and better organize and manage the [codebase](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/).

- Component-based structure: Angular components are the backbone of the application. A component represents a piece of the UI and can be composed of other components to create complex [UI elements](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- Templates: Templates are HTML files that define how the UI looks. Angular enables us to use programming constructs like if conditions, loops, etc., to render and control the [UI dynamically](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- Two-way data binding: Data binding is the process of synchronizing data between the UI and the component logic. Angular supports two-way data binding, which means any changes in the UI are automatically reflected in the [component and vice versa](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- Dependency injection: Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows us to inject dependencies (such as services, pipes, etc.) into components or other classes without creating them manually. This makes the code more [testable, maintainable, and modular](https://angular.io/guide/architecture.)

- Routing: Routing is the mechanism of navigating between different views or components based on the URL or user actions. Angular provides a router module that enables us to define routes and navigate between them [programmatically or declaratively](https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- Angular Forms: Angular forms are a set of modules that provide tools for creating and validating forms in Angular applications. They support two approaches: [template-driven forms and reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- HTTP Module: HTTP module is a service that allows us to communicate with remote servers using HTTP protocols. It supports common HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and [handles errors and responses asynchronously](https://angular.io/guide/architecture).

- Testing: Angular is built with testing in mind. It comes bundled with a testing framework called Jasmine and a test runner called Karma. It also provides utilities for mocking dependencies, [simulating user interactions, isolating components, etc](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-introduction/https://angular.io/guide/architecture)

## How to use this repository?
This repository contains various code examples and tutorials that demonstrate how to use Angular features and concepts. You can clone this repository or download it as a zip file and run the examples locally using the Angular CLI.

To run an example, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you have not already done so.
2. Install the Angular CLI globally using npm install -g @angular/cli.
3. Navigate to the folder of the example you want to run (for example, cd angular-tutorial/hello-world).
4. Run npm install to install the dependencies.
5. Run ng serve to start a development server.
6. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to see the example running.

You can also modify the code and see the changes reflected in the browser automatically.

This was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.
